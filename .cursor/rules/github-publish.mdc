# Quick GitHub Publish Rule

To publish this project as a new public GitHub repository with minimal interaction, run the following command in the project root:

```
gh repo create <repo-name> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

- Replace `<repo-name>` with your desired repository name (or use the folder name).
- The command will prompt you to authenticate with GitHub if you haven't already.
- This will:
  - Create a new public repository on your GitHub account
  - Set it as the remote named `origin`
  - Push your current code to GitHub

After running, your repository URL will be shown in the output. You can share this link with others.

**Requirements:**
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](mdc:https:/cli.github.com) must be installed and authenticated.
- Your project should already be a git repository (run `git init` if not).
- All changes should be committed before running the command.
